 * desktop Obsidian window, Android emulator window, and Appium server console
 * are shown on screen. All three surfaces are **hidden by default** (`is*Visible`
 * is `false` when omitted) so an integration run never steals focus or pops
 * windows in front of the user.
 *
 * Kept separate from the integration-only launch/spawn code (`transport-factory`,
 * `transport-desktop-cdp`, `obsidian-instance`, all excluded from unit tests) so
 * the hidden-by-default resolution stays unit-testable — those launchers need a
 * real Obsidian / emulator / Appium server.

 * The harness hides the window by moving it **off-screen** (not minimizing it).
 * An off-screen window still reports `visibilityState: 'visible'` to Chromium, so
 * `setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `:hover`, and trusted input all keep
 * working exactly as when visible — but only if Chromium never decides to
 * background it. These flags guarantee that: native occlusion tracking is
 * disabled and the timer/renderer backgrounding heuristics are switched off, so
 * an off-screen (or covered) renderer is never throttled or frozen.
 *
 * A *minimized* window, by contrast, freezes `requestAnimationFrame` regardless
 * of any flag (there is no surface to composite), which is why the harness moves
 * the window off-screen rather than minimizing it.
